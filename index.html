<h3><a name="WHY NMD?"></a> NMD?</h3>
<p>Well if you talk about passion preference i choose New Media Design because it always fascinated me how people with art skills either if its paining , book writing , or graphics designer interacts with their audience and they actually do have a lot of influence.Other than that i wanted to learn who website which are a great need for todays world as everything is going online and world is becoming a internet globe so it was a necessity to learn it on the other hand if you talk about career opportunity , I think it is one of the most nedding and friendly jobs for the upcoming days like in covid the world was depressed to not be able to work but the graphic designer and web developers were working from home and were quite comfortable.</p>

<li>CRICKET</li>
<p>i think it is good to have a healthy activity in your schedule and i love to paly cricket and it also enables me to hang out with my friends who are also studing in different universities and can,t meet each others regularly.So all in all i like to keep my myself moving but sometimes cricket can be dangerous and you can get injured like i broke my finger while try to catch the ball. </p>

<div class="html">
<li>HTML AND CSS</li>
<p>This one of my latest hobby i added into my list but i am making sure to never stop doing that hobby. To be honest it is quite a fun to experiment and create different work by using syntax and tags. I think we should always make the thing which needs a focus a hobby in our life either if its accademic or personal due to this factor we try our best with pure dedication to achieve the goal.</p>
